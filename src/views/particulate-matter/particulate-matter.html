    <p>
        Particulate matter are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. They have impacts on climate and
        precipitation that adversely affect human health, in addition to direct inhalation. Particulate matter smaller
        than about 10 micrometers, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Fine particulate
        matter (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles may pass
        through the lungs to affect other organs.
